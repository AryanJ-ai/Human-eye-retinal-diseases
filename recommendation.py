cnv = """
## Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV)

### Overview
CNV is characterized by the growth of new blood vessels from the choroid through breaks in Bruch's membrane into the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) or neurosensory retina.

### OCT Findings
- **Subretinal fluid accumulation**
- **Pigment epithelial detachment (PED)**
- **Hyperreflective material above RPE**
- **Loss of normal retinal architecture**

### Clinical Significance
- Often associated with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
- Can lead to rapid vision loss if untreated
- May cause metamorphopsia (visual distortion)

### Treatment Recommendations
1. **Immediate ophthalmology referral** (within 1-2 weeks)
2. **Anti-VEGF therapy** consideration
3. **Photodynamic therapy** in select cases
4. **Regular monitoring** with OCT

### Follow-up
- Monthly injections initially
- OCT monitoring every 1-2 months
- Visual acuity assessments
"""

dme = """
## Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)

### Overview
DME occurs when blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula, causing swelling and vision problems in diabetic patients.

### OCT Findings
- **Retinal thickening** (>250 μm central subfield)
- **Intraretinal cystoid spaces**
- **Hyperreflective foci**
- **Disrupted retinal layers**

### Clinical Significance
- Leading cause of vision loss in diabetic patients
- Can occur at any stage of diabetic retinopathy
- Often bilateral condition

### Treatment Recommendations
1. **Optimize glycemic control** (HbA1c <7%)
2. **Blood pressure management** (<130/80 mmHg)
3. **Anti-VEGF injections** (first-line therapy)
4. **Steroid implants** in select cases
5. **Laser photocoagulation** if persistent

### Follow-up
- Monthly monitoring initially
- OCT every 4-6 weeks during treatment
- Annual dilated eye exams for all diabetics
"""

drusen = """
## Drusen (Early Age-Related Macular Degeneration)

### Overview
Drusen are yellowish deposits beneath the retina, composed of lipids, proteins, and cellular debris. They are early signs of AMD.

### OCT Findings
- **Dome-shaped elevations** of the RPE
- **Hyperreflective material** beneath RPE
- **RPE irregularities**
- **Preserved photoreceptor layers** (in early stages)

### Types
- **Hard drusen:** Small (<63 μm), well-defined
- **Soft drusen:** Large (>125 μm), poorly defined
- **Cuticular drusen:** Multiple small drusen

### Clinical Significance
- Risk factor for progression to advanced AMD
- Larger and more numerous drusen = higher risk
- May be asymptomatic initially

### Management Recommendations
1. **AREDS2 supplementation** (if intermediate AMD)
2. **Lifestyle modifications:**
   - Smoking cessation
   - UV protection
   - Healthy diet rich in antioxidants
3. **Regular monitoring** every 6-12 months
4. **Home monitoring** with Amsler grid

### Follow-up
- Annual comprehensive eye exams
- OCT monitoring every 6-12 months
- Patient education on AMD progression signs
"""

normal = """
## Normal Retina

### Overview
A normal OCT scan shows well-preserved retinal architecture with distinct layers and normal foveal contour.

### OCT Findings
- **Preserved foveal contour** with normal depression
- **Distinct retinal layers:**
  - NFL (Nerve Fiber Layer)
  - GCL (Ganglion Cell Layer)
  - IPL (Inner Plexiform Layer)
  - INL (Inner Nuclear Layer)
  - OPL (Outer Plexiform Layer)
  - ONL (Outer Nuclear Layer)
  - ELM (External Limiting Membrane)
  - IS/OS (Inner/Outer Segment junction)
  - RPE (Retinal Pigment Epithelium)

### Normal Measurements
- **Central subfield thickness:** 200-300 μm
- **Foveal pit depth:** ~150 μm
- **No intraretinal or subretinal fluid**
- **Intact photoreceptor layers**

### Clinical Significance
- Baseline for future comparisons
- Rules out retinal pathology
- Confirms healthy retinal function

### Recommendations
1. **Continue routine eye care**
2. **Annual comprehensive eye exams**
3. **Maintain healthy lifestyle:**
   - Balanced diet
   - UV protection
   - No smoking
   - Regular exercise

### Follow-up
- Routine annual eye exams
- OCT as clinically indicated
- Earlier follow-up if symptoms develop
